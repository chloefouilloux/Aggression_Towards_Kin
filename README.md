Hello! This is the R markdown and raw data supporting the "Size-dependent tradeoffs in aggressive behavior towards kin" paper by Fouilloux et al. (2020). 
Please let me know if there are any errors or improvements. 

BREAKDOWN OF CONTENTS:

ETHICS STATEMENT:
All animals used in this experiment were healthy (assessed to the best of our abilities) and maintained in the most naturally-mimicing conditions possible in a laboratory setting. Aggression trials were ended prematurely if ever levels rose to a point of inflicting permanent damage. We acknowledge here that working with animals is a privilege, and we do no take our responsibility to their welfare lightly.
